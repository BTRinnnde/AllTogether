        <p>
            Although I have a lot on my plate right now and things are taking longer than I'd like, 
            I envision All Together growing more and more in the near future. To make this happen, 
            there are several things I'm working on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll be updating this website to include all the necessary information, as well as live 
            updates on streams and income. I also want to create a way for all of us to decide 
            together where the money goes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I'm planning to create more social media content to keep everyone updated 
            and engaged.
