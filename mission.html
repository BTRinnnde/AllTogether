        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            All Together was created to offer a new way for people to contribute to causes 
            that matter and need funding. Our mission is simple: we take 100% of the royalties 
            earned from music streams and give them directly to someone in need.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe in complete transparency—nothing will be hidden from you. We'll provide 
            regular updates on streams, income, and exactly where the money goes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our vision is to provide music that fits any situation you find yourself in. 
            This way, you're not just supporting a good cause—you're also enjoying the music 
            you play. Together, we can make a meaningful impact simply by listening.
